# Usage
facebook_ui = FacebookUI()
# ```

# **Changes Made:**

# 1.  **Method Ordering:** I've rearranged the methods to reflect a more logical order of operations for designing and implementing a user interface.
# 2.  **Method Calls:** In the `__init__` method, I've added calls to each of the other methods in sequence, ensuring that they are executed in the correct order.
# 3.  **Docstrings:** Each method now has a docstring providing a brief description of its purpose and functionality.
# 4.  **Comments:** Additional comments have been added to explain specific steps or tasks within each method.

# **Additional Notes:**

# *   This improved version still lacks actual implementation for creating the UI components, styling them with CSS, adding interactive elements, integrating with a backend API (if applicable), and testing the UI.
# *   Depending on your requirements, you can implement these features by using various libraries or frameworks like Flask or Django for the backend API, Bootstrap or Materialize for CSS, JavaScript libraries like React or jQuery, and automated testing tools like Selenium.

# **Commit Message:**

# ```bash
# Improved FacebookUI class with logical method order and added docstrings.
# ```
