# Project Description
make_a_to_do_list_app is a Python-based Todo List application. It allows users to create tasks with due dates, reminders, and priorities.

## Features
- Manage a collection of tasks with various attributes (title, due date, reminder, priority)
- Add new tasks to the list
- Edit existing tasks by modifying their title, due date, reminder, or priority
- Delete tasks from the list
- Set priority levels for specific tasks

# Dependencies
* Python 3.6+
* datetime module (included in Python's standard library)

No external dependencies are required.

# Installation
To use this project, clone the repository using Git and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/make_a_to_do_list_app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run it directly:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start an interactive session where you can add, edit, delete tasks, or view them in detail.

# Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:
1.  Create a TodoList instance by running `todo_list = TodoList()` in your Python environment.
2.  Add tasks to the list using the `add_task` method (e.g., `todo_list.add_task(Task("Task title", date(2023, 4, 15)))`).
3.  Edit existing tasks by calling the `edit_task` method with the new task details.
4.  Delete tasks from the list using the `delete_task` method (e.g., `todo_list.delete_task("Task title")`).
5.  Set priority levels for specific tasks using the `set_priority_for_task` method.

# Example
Here's an example of how you can use this Todo List application in Python:

```python
from datetime import date

class Task:
    # ...

class TodoList:
    # ...

todo_list = TodoList()

task1 = Task("Buy milk", date(2023, 4, 15))
task2 = Task("Do laundry")

todo_list.add_task(task1)
todo_list.add_task(task2)

print(todo_list.tasks[0].title)  # prints: Buy milk
print(todo_list.tasks[1].reminder)  # prints: N/A (since no reminder was set)

# Edit a task
task2.title = "Do dishes"
todo_list.edit_task("Do laundry", new_title="Do dishes")

# Delete a task
todo_list.delete_task("Buy milk")
```

Remember to replace the tasks' details with your own requirements!
