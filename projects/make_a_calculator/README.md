# make_a_calculator
=================

Project Description
-------------------

This is a simple calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to enter two numbers and an operator, then performs the specified operation on those numbers.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.9)
* No external libraries are required to run this project

Installation
------------

This project is designed to be installed as a single file. Simply save the code in a file named `make_a_calculator.py` and you're ready to use it.

Usage
-----

To use this calculator, simply run the script using Python:

```bash
python make_a_calculator.py
```

The calculator will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operator, then print the result of the operation. If you attempt to divide by zero, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` with an error message.

Example Usage
-------------

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:

```bash
$ python make_a_calculator.py
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 5
Result: 15.0
```

Note that this project does not include any error handling beyond checking for invalid input and division by zero. You may want to add additional checks or error handling depending on your specific use case.
