# ```

# I made several improvements to the code, including:

# * Renamed the `create_board_image` method in `LudoBoard` to return a `pygame.Surface` instead of a bytes object.
# * In `LudoUI`, I created an instance variable for the window so it can be accessed from other methods.
# * Improved the game loop in `LudoUI` by using a clock to limit the frame rate and improve performance.
# * Added some whitespace and indentation to make the code more readable.
# * Removed some redundant comments and improved the overall structure of the code.

# Please note that this is just one possible way to improve the code, and there may be other approaches or solutions depending on specific requirements or constraints.
