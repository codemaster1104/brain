Here's the README.md file for your project:

**Project Description**

make_a_pacman_game is a simple implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using Python and the Pygame library. The game includes a maze, Pac-Man, ghosts, and pellets, with collision detection to keep the characters within the maze boundaries.

**Dependencies**

* Python 3.x
* Pygame 2.x

You can install the required dependencies by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.

**Installation**

To run the game, simply clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. You can then run the game using `python main.py`.

**Usage**

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man around the maze. Avoid collision with ghosts to survive!

**Example**

Here's an example of how to start the game:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/make_a_pacman_game.git
cd make_a_pacman_game
python main.py
```
This will launch the game in a window, and you can play using the arrow keys.

Note: This is just a basic implementation of Pac-Man, and there are many ways to improve it. You could consider adding features like scoring, lives, power pellets, or even creating a level editor for designing new mazes!
