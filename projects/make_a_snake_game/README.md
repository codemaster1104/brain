# make_a_snake_game
======================

## Project Description
-------------------

This project generates and displays a random game board using Python. The game board consists of cells with hidden numbers, and mines are randomly placed on the board.

## Dependencies
------------

*   Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.9)

No external dependencies required.

## Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/make_a_snake_game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd make_a_snake_game`
3. Run the code using Python: `python main.py` (assuming you have saved the code in a file called `main.py`)

## Usage
-----

### Generating and Displaying a Game Board

To generate and display a random 10x10 game board, simply run the code:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will output the generated game board to the console.

### Modifying the Number of Mines

To change the number of mines on the board, modify the `NUM_MINES` constant in the code and re-run it. For example:

```python
# Set NUM_MINES to 20
NUM_MINES = 20

# Run the code again
python main.py
```

## Example
-----

### Generating a Game Board with 10x10 Cells and 10 Mines

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will output a random game board with 10 mines to the console.

Note: You can modify the code to generate boards of different sizes or add more features as needed.
